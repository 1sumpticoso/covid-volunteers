## What is Nu Te Supara Frate?
  
Nu Te Supara Frate means "Don't Get Mad, Brother" in Romanian, and it is a fitting name for a game that can test your patience and luck. The game is played on a board with four colored areas (red, green, yellow, and blue) and a central track with 40 spaces. Each player has four pieces of their own color that start in their home area. The goal of the game is to move all your pieces from your home area to your finish area, which is opposite to your home area on the board.
  
To move your pieces, you need to roll a six-sided die and move one of your pieces as many spaces as the number you rolled. You can only move a piece out of your home area if you roll a six. If you roll a six, you can also roll again and move another piece. However, if you roll three sixes in a row, you lose your turn and have to wait until your next turn.
  
The game gets interesting when your pieces land on spaces occupied by other players' pieces. If that happens, you can capture their piece and send it back to their home area. This means that you can delay or prevent them from reaching their finish area. However, they can also do the same to you, so you have to be careful and strategic about where you move your pieces.
  
There are also some special spaces on the board that have different effects. For example, there are star spaces that are safe zones where you cannot capture or be captured by other players. There are also arrow spaces that allow you to skip some spaces and move faster. There are also bridge spaces that connect two opposite sides of the board and let you cross over to another area.
