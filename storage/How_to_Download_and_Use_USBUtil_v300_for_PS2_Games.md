In this article, we will show you how to download and use USBUtil v3.00 for PS2 games. You will need a PC, a USB drive, and some PS2 games in ISO format.
 
## Step 1: Download USBUtil v3.00
 
The latest version of USBUtil is v3.00, which is still in beta stage. You can download it from the official thread on PSX-Place[^1^] or from the resources section[^2^]. The program is available in multiple languages, including English.
 
## Step 2: Install USBUtil v3.00
 
Once you have downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to a folder on your PC. You will see a file called USBUtil.exe, which is the main executable of the program. You can run it by double-clicking on it or by creating a shortcut on your desktop.
 
## Step 3: Format Your USB Drive
 
Before you can use USBUtil to manage your PS2 games, you need to format your USB drive to FAT32. This is the file system that the PS2 can read from the USB port. You can use any tool that can format a USB drive to FAT32, such as Windows Explorer or Disk Management.
 
To format your USB drive using Windows Explorer, follow these steps:
 
- Plug your USB drive into your PC and open Windows Explorer.
- Right-click on your USB drive and select Format.
- Select FAT32 as the file system and click Start.
- Wait for the formatting process to finish and click OK.

## Step 4: Add PS2 Games to Your USB Drive
 
Now that your USB drive is formatted to FAT32, you can use USBUtil to add PS2 games to it. You can either create new games in .ul format from ISO files or convert existing games in other formats to .ul format.
 
To create new games in .ul format from ISO files, follow these steps:

- Run USBUtil.exe and click on File > Create game from ISO.
- Select the ISO file of the PS2 game you want to add and click Open.
- Select the destination folder on your USB drive where you want to save the game and click OK.
- If the ISO file is larger than 4 GB, USBUtil will ask you if you want to split it into smaller parts. Click Yes if you want to do so or No if you don't.
- Wait for the creation process to finish and click OK.

To convert existing games in other formats to .ul format, follow these steps:

- Run USBUtil.exe and click on File > Convert game.
- Select the source folder where your game files are located and click OK.
- Select the destination folder on your USB drive where you want to save the converted game and click OK.
- Select the format of your game files from the drop-down menu and click OK.
- Wait for the conversion process to finish and click OK.

## Step 5: Play PS2 Games from Your USB Drive
 
After you have added some PS2 games to your USB drive using USBUtil, you can play them from your PS2 console using a loader such as USB Extreme or USB Advance. You will need a modded PS2 or a swap disc method to run these loaders.
 
To play PS2 games from your USB drive using USB Extreme or USB Advance, follow these steps:
